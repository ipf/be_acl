Screenshots
^^^^^^^^^^^

|img-1| This is how the edit permission screen works. As the ACLs work
transparently, there is no noticeable difference in TYPO3 except in
the Web->Access-Module. Beneath the table, you see the “Add ACL”
button.

|img-2|

You can see the permissions for each group where there is an ACL set
here. This screen shows you for example that there is a new ACL on
“page1” for the group “g1” (because the permissions change there.)

|img-3|

There is a new user/group selector in the “Permissions” view which can
be found in Web->Access. With these selectors it is possible to define
which groups and users should be shown in the matrix. This makes
especially bigger matrices easier to handle.
